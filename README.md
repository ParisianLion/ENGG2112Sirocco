# ENGG2112Sirocco

Stage 1
- code up environment
  - import heat map
  - convert heat map to vector field
  - export vector field in appropriate data format

Stage 2
- code up flight simulator (launching via windows 10/11)
- connect vector field to x,y,z components at various points in the glider's flight
- code up a recieve function to get relevant variables for reward function
- code up action function to select actions from some set of potential control surface changes

Stage 3
- connect reinforcement learning algorithm via PyTorch library
